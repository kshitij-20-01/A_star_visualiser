# A* Algorithm Visualizer

## Project Description:
A* Algorithm Visualizer is a project that allows users to interactively explore how the A* pathfinding algorithm works. The program visualizes the steps taken by the algorithm to find the shortest path on a grid-based environment.

## üöÄ Features:
- **Interactive Grid**: Users can place start and end points, obstacles, and watch the A* algorithm find the optimal path.
- **Customizable Obstacles**: Allows placement of walls and barriers to test different pathfinding scenarios.
- **Real-time Visualization**: See the algorithm explore nodes in real time.
